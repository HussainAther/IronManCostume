Once you have all the files in your PC, you proceed to print each part.
Cutting the pieces by the solid line.
The dotted line is for "mountain" folding and the dot-line-dot is for "valley" folding.
Match each tab with its corresponding number using hot glue, helped with the Pepakura Viewer to identify easily each piece.
Do the same with all the parts one by one to avoid confusing the pieces.

Prepare a table with aluminum foil, spray lubricant over it. This will help us to avoid the resin stick to the table.
Cut the Fiber Glass mat in small or big strips depending on the part size.
Put your gloves, protective eye glasses and respirator. Mix a small portion of the resin (I used 1/4 of a cup) with the hardener (10 to 20 drops, depending on the weather, if it's hot, with 10 drops it's ok. As long as you work with this you will know how many drops you'll need). Once the hardener is added, you will only have about 15 minutes to work with it.
Start applying one strip of Fiberglass Mat, and resin over it in the inner side of the part. Repeat this until you have all the parts covering it.
After applying the first layer let dry about 15 mins, and continue with the second layer. This is really important on the big parts, like the chest, back, legs, helmet etc, because one layer is flexible and weak.
Resin the outside of the part very well and let it dry 24 hours.
After the part is solid to the touch, trim the excess of fiber glass mat using the dremel tool .

Put yon our gloves, protective eye glasses, and respirator. Mix a small portion of the body filler and hardener until you have a one-color mix.
1. First body filler layer: Using the squeegee, apply body filler all over the part to give some body while trying to let a smooth finish, let it dry some minutes (time depends on the amount of catalyst) until it is perfectly solid. Using 40 grit Sandpaper and the Rubber Sanding Block, sand it just to remove the sharp points and edges. Clean up the dust with the wet rag.
2. Second body filler layer: Apply body filler giving the necessary rounded shape of the part, and let it dry. Sand it with the 40 grid Sandpaper and the Rubber Sanding Block. After the surface is smooth, use the 150 grit Sandpaper and sand it again and you'll notice a smoothest surface. Clean up with the wet rag.
3. Third body filler layer: Watch for voids and imperfections, apply body filler to it. Sand it using the 150 grit Sandpaper. Clean up with the wet rag. Now you should have an almost perfect shape of the part.
Using the squeegee apply one very thin layer of Spot Putty to all the surfaces, as thin the layer is, the fastest it will dry. After some minutes with the Spot Putty dried, sand it using the 600 grit Sandpaper, Clean up with the wet rag again.
Use the dremel tool for line details, or any other kind of detail you need or want.

The shoes need to be filled to support the weight.
After assembling the 3 parts of the shoes, drill a hole in front of the shoe, and another hole on the back using the dremel tool.
Fill it with foam and let it dry 24 hours.The shoe now should support a person.
To link the forearm and the bicep, drill a 1/4" hole on the biceps and elbow as shown in the photo. (this can be performed after or before primer, I did it after apply primer)
-Can of foam ($5)
-4 Screws (1/4")

Put your gloves, protective eye glasses and respirator. Apply sandable primer to all the parts (2 layers)
Let it dry at least 30-60 mins.
Fill the bucket with water. Wet the part with the sponge and sand the parts using the 1000 or 2000 grit Water Sandpaper. Sand it trying to do not remove the primer at all (if you remove some primer at the edges it's ok).
Now you can start with the fun stage, where all your work will get shiny and awesome.
Paint all the parts with chrome paint, you'll be impressed of how good it looks.
Apply 2 coats letting dry at least 30 mins between coats.
The chrome is the base color in order that you'll have a metallic finish.
After 24 hours you can continue with the gold coat, paint all the gold details and parts. There's no problem if you paint accidentally some area that should be red.
Wait another 24 hours and cover with newspaper and masking tape areas that should be chrome or gold. Now you can apply 2 to 4 coats of the red paint depending on the intense of color that you want. 
Let the parts dry for at least  3-5 days, and now you are ready to assembly and wear them!
